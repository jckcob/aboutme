  I played violin for over 9 years but after 9 years I still don&#39;t think I
  am very good but I really enjoy playing it.

  Playing boardgames with friends or family
</h2>
<p>
  Board games are fun. I prefer board games over video games because of the real
  life interaction and I am not bounded by the rules of the virtual world.
</p>
<p>My Favorite games are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Coup</li>
  <li>Secret Hitler</li>
  <li>Chess</li>
  <li>Risk</li>
  <li>Catan</li>
</ol>

  Investing into stocks that barely break even
</h2>
<p>
  I wouldn&#39;t say I am the best investor that is why I am doing IT instead of
  finance but I do live by the philosophy of not pulling out of the market when
  there is a dip.
