<h2 id="cold-play">Cold Play</h2>
<p>
  Cold Play is a band that is really nostalgic for me. My parents used to play
  it a lot in my house when I was younger. Sadly the lead singer got a divorce
  and I think he kinda lost his touch for music since...

  Favorite song: <strong><em>The Scientist</em></strong>
</p>

  This is a band I started listening to in college. My neighbor played it when
  we were showering together I told him I liked it then he shared me his
  playlists and now I listen to it.

  Favorite song: <strong><em>Soldiers Side</em></strong>

<p>
  Eminem is a very good rapper in the way that his raps flow and they also tell
  a story. It&#39;s also fascinating to see his music change as he gets older.

  Favorite song: <strong><em>The Real Slim Shady</em></strong>

  I do appreciate the old orchestra and piano composers unfortunately Liszt,
  Mozart and Tchaikovsky haven&#39;t dropped a new album in years.:(
