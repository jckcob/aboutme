      Star Wars The Clone Wars The marketed this show as a &quot;childrens
      show&quot; but that is full of lies. It explored really matured content
      that flew over my head as a young kid so when I grew up and went back to
      this show it was really good because I finally understood the message the
      show was trying to convey.

      Demon Slayer The animation team really put their heart and soul into this
      show and it really shows with how detailed the animation is. The show also
      does a really good job at blending 2d art with 3d objects which is very
      hard to balance when making a show.

      Jujutsu Kaisen One of my first animes I watched was naruto and this show
      basically does what naruto does but without the filler arcs inbetween. The
      show has significantly better pacing and the characters are more
      realatable to real people.
