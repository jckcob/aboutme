  This was my childhood game I would always default to playing this game
  whenever I had free time to play. This is the best game ever don't argue with
  me on it.

  I played this game mainly as a way to connect to my younger brother and
  cousins. Despite how <em>stupid</em> the game looks it is a deceptively fun
  game.

  This game has its <em>moments</em>. I only still play because my friends do
  but when I do there is always some stupid update that takes forever to
  download.
